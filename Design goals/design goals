Personal design goals: 
Hello y'all. Glad that we can be able to communicate from the MPlab to the processor by using window rather than Macbook( which previously
caused Sam's problem)
Here is a few questions that we can answer to set our design goals before meeting on Saturday:

Which is your design goals? Which should be "must-have" or "should-have" or "might-have"?
What time is your best meeting time and/or shopping time on Saturday?
Feel free to add more if you need something.

Sam's Design Goals:
  MUST HAVES
    Pocket sized, at least 2hr battery life
    accepts input frequency from 0 to 25MHz (pure sine/saw/square)
    Text display
    end-user replacable battery
    end-user expandable (unused pins broken out, reprogrammable MCU)
    easy to open (on purpose) enclosure
    Intuitive UI (keypad or DMM style dial)
    end-user cost (MSRP) <$40
  NICE TO HAVES
    Graphical display
    Absolute capacitance measuring (determine cap values)
    Vpp and dc-offset measuring
    Audio frequency FFT
    Input up to 100MHz  (gross or ugly signal)
    Internal rechargable battery
    hard to open (on accident) enclosure
    replacable input port (in case of failure)
    end-user cost (MSRP) <$20
