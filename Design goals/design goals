Personal design goals: 
Hello y'all. Glad that we can be able to communicate from the MPlab to the processor by using window rather than Macbook( which previously
caused Sam's problem)
Here is a few questions that we can answer to set our design goals before meeting on Saturday:

Which is your design goals? Which should be "must-have" or "should-have" or "might-have"?
What time is your best meeting time and/or shopping time on Saturday?
Feel free to add more if you need something.
