Personal design goals: 
Hello y'all. Glad that we can be able to communicate from the MPlab to the processor by using window rather than Macbook( which previously
caused Sam's problem)
Here is a few questions that we can answer to set our design goals before meeting on Saturday:

Which is your design goals? Which should be "must-have" or "should-have" or "might-have"?
Feel free to add more if you need something.

*********************************************************************
Sam's Design Goals:
  MUST HAVES
    Pocket sized, at least 2hr battery life
    accepts input frequency from 0 to 25MHz (pure sine/saw/square)
    Text display
    end-user replacable battery
    end-user expandable (unused pins broken out, reprogrammable MCU)
    easy to open (on purpose) enclosure
    Intuitive UI (keypad or DMM style dial)
    end-user cost (MSRP) <$40
  NICE TO HAVES
    Graphical display
    Absolute capacitance measuring (determine cap values)
    Vpp and dc-offset measuring
    Audio frequency FFT
    Input up to 100MHz  (gross or ugly signal)
    Internal rechargable battery
    hard to open (on accident) enclosure
    replacable input port (in case of failure)
    end-user cost (MSRP) <$20

Tai's design goals:
Must:
Input frequency: 0 - 50 MHz( wouldn't mind if 25 MHz, but a longer is better)
Text display (only number is neccessary)
It has to have a fast response. 
Reliable result with small uncertainty +/- 1 %
Some function I recommend: 
CVref
OPA/PGA
ADC high resolution
IC/OC


Shoud:
Battery is good. But also not very important. it could be powered through USB cable. 
Inexpensive
**I don't really understand the Chip function, so I'm looking for a recommend from you guys.

******************************************************************************
DESIGN GOALS: -sara
Must:
Be mobile and fit in hand
Be easy to charge, ie: usb charge or replaceable battery
Fast output
Prints a text display
Under 50$ initial cost with ~5$ user replacements(if applicable)  
Accept a variety of general waveforms 
Reach the high frequency band 
|||
Should:
Any signal 
Lit display
Easy data transfer
Easily expandable

********************************************************************************
Will's Design Requirements

MUST: Count frequency of some simple periodic input and display to an output screen
      Be small enough to fit on workbench
      Capture frequency up to 1MHz
      cost < $40 / board
      
SHOULD: Use a common microcontroller such as ATMEGA or PICMICRO
        Capture frequency up to 20MHz
        Be ~ 3 cm x 3 cm or smaller
        cost < $20 / board
        use simple lcd display
        have a nice plastic / 3d printed enclosure
        
NICE TO HAVE: DSP functionality - report frequency spectrum of sound wave
              Function generator - generate functions up to 20 MHz as well as detect (reverse functionality)
