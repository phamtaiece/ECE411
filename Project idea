Hello!
This is where we post new ideas for the project.
Let's start with some questions: 
1. What is your idea? goals to achieve?
2. Why do you think it meet the practicum's requirements?
3. Why do you think that idea be a good fit for 10 weeks projects and 2 credits class?
4. When is the best time for team meeting regarding to ur schedule?
5. anything else?

Tai, let me start first:

The idea is not a new or fascinating idea. However, I think it’s simple enough for 2 credits class and difficult enough for a new engineer?
I won’t be happy if the project is new but unpredicting the outcome.

Project: Create an auto desk lamp. 
Purpose: The desk lamp will sense the amount of sunlight/light to turn on by itself.
Need: 
A light sensor. 
A microprocessor to receive the input from the light sensor and converter to the output signal that light up the lamp.
An actuator is a desk lamp/ any kind of lamp.
Why is the project good for practicum?
Simple but containing all must-requirements.
Inexpensive.
Re-usable after project is done.
Can be added more feature if we have more time such as color changing; changing color depending on amount of sunlight/light,
add timer like a watch???
This should be a popular idea? How about create a system that can use GPS to know the exact time and turn on the light
between 6 pm – 6 am, then turn off?

The best time for me to work on the project is Tuesday after 12:00 pm and Friday? (But I prefer Tuesday)
