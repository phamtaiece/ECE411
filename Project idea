Hello!
This is where we post new ideas for the project.
Let's start with some questions: 
1. What is your idea? goals to achieve?
2. Why do you think it meet the practicum's requirements?
3. Why do you think that idea be a good fit for 10 weeks projects and 2 credits class?
4. When is the best time for team meeting regarding to ur schedule?
5. anything else?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %Use this to separate ur idea

Tai, let me start first:

The idea is not a new or fascinating idea. However, I think it’s simple enough for 2 credits class and difficult enough for a new engineer?
I won’t be happy if the project is new but unpredicting the outcome.

Project: Create an auto desk lamp. 
Purpose: The desk lamp will sense the amount of sunlight/light to turn on by itself.
Need: 
A light sensor. 
A microprocessor to receive the input from the light sensor and converter to the output signal that light up the lamp.
An actuator is a desk lamp/ any kind of lamp.
Why is the project good for practicum?
Simple but containing all must-requirements.
Inexpensive.
Re-usable after project is done.
Can be added more feature if we have more time such as color changing; changing color depending on amount of sunlight/light,
add timer like a watch???
This should be a popular idea? How about create a system that can use GPS to know the exact time and turn on the light
between 6 pm – 6 am, then turn off?

The best time for me to work on the project is Tuesday after 12:00 pm and Friday? (But I prefer Tuesday)

Sam, let me stumble my way through this transition:
**************************
Discount Frequency counter
**************************
Use a cheap MCU/DSP to count the peaks of an input signal from 0Hz to 25MHz and output the results to a display.
Design analog input stage for signal conditioning.

Value:    no cheap (<$50) AC analysis gear exists that works with any real amount of reliability/accuracy, so why not build
          a cheap version of 1970's bench gear.
$Value:   ~$20 per board without enclosure
Timeline: could be an 8-week project for simplified input-stage, additional functionality could be implemented (LCR meter,
          f-gen, et al.) using extra pins/time or focus on power optimization.
Bogus:    I have no idea what the minimum SNR of the input would have to be for this to work reliably.
Bonus:    I already have a broken out dsPIC DSP from microchip that can do this, as well as the programmer/debugger
          (which can do in-circuit-serial-programming which meets practicum requirements) and done a bunch of groundwork
          already as I'm doing something similar for VMS, so we could start, like, tomorrow.
          
By the end of the term we would each have a pocket sized device that can do simple frequency measuments... or more! Great 
for parties!

I am free to meet MW <4:40
                  T  1:00<meet<4:40, or >6:30
                  R  12:00<meet<4:40, or >6:30
                  FS All day
I would rather meet for a shorter amount of time, multiple times a week. That way people who have excess time can continue
working, and people with obligations go do their thing. That way we are guaranteed to touch base face-to-face multiple times
a week about our project.

Hi all,

Will Here. Sara and I had come up with this
*************************
Auto Plant Care System
**************************
Use simple off-the-shelf sensors for moisture, temperature, ph and design a system which monitors these values and sends signals
to actuators to deliver water/chemicals open/close shades automatically as needed.

Cheap, relatively simple, meets requirements
can use ethan's wireless zigby network to create many low-cost nodes for a complete package

I am free to meet   MW <4:40
                    T/Th >12:00
            
            I agree with Sam that meeting multiple times a week would be good. I would like to meet Tues/Thur after class if 
            possible - or at 1, it seems Sam has an obligation 12-1 on Tue

Hey ya'll happy Monday! 

I had another idea about making an alarm clock that would slowly increase the volume to wake you up slowly.
It would play a radio station of some kind perhaps a satellite radio or something I think there are chip sets for pretty cheap on adafruit. 
Personally I would like to be gently woken up with soft jazz in the am haha. Probably not the best idea out of the lot, but figured I'd 
throw it out there. I really like Sam's idea best and think there is a great deal to learn for me especially since I am in signals right now,
but am worried about time and 2 credit class yada yada. And the other ideas seem reasonable and could easily meet all the requirements.

So perhaps we need to get a meeting time in? 

I am avail:
mon/wed <440 AND >630
tues/thurs >12 AND <430 AND >630
Perhaps since we all have Analog today we could meet at 330/4 pm or after his class and chat?  

==================================================================================================
we all agree with Sam project, I like Sam's project too. 
Let's wait until this Thursday, to see how's everything. Then we will start building a timeline, tasks and responsibility by next week. 
-Tai
