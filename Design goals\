Personal design goals: 
Hello y'all. Glad that we can be able to communicate from the MPlab to the processor by using window rather than Macbook( which previously
caused Sam's problem)
Here is a few questions that we can answer to set our design goals before meeting on Saturday:

The appropriate frequency you want our practicum focus on? ( ex: 0 - 25 MHz)
Which chip do you recommend? Sam will be upload a list of 16 bit and 32 bit chip soon.
which feature are "must-have" or "should-have"?
